#Riley and Max's project
#Besides the basic function of the required rubric...
#we added a randomly generated description of each pet but it specifies each speices
#When you add a pet you must specifiy name and species 
#We have a message print out when you killed a pet
#The cats health are rounding slightly differently but they are the same health algorithm  (the cats health with vary cat to cat due to rounding)(also genetics)
